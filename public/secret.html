  <h1>Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Whenever you travel abroad bring a new soundtrack for each place you visit, preferably one you have never heard before. In the future, every time you listen to each soundtrack again they will bring you vivid memories of the places you have visited.</li>
    <li>Be the person you would like your child to be be. It more clearly defines your own convictions, desires, goals, and motivates you to be your best.</li>
    <li>When a friend is upset, ask them one simple question before saying anything else: 'Do you want to talk about it or do you want to be distracted from it?'</li>
    <li>If you ever forget your WiFi password or you want to get your school WiFi password etc. Just type this command into the command line of a computer already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear</li>
  </ul>
